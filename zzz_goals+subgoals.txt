DONE goal - get Gurobi working on lab computer in Python
{
    - DONE create new repo so I can mess with the docker installation quickly
    - DONE download Gurobi and set up academic license
    - DONE get Gurobi working in Python (include the gurobipy in the docker file)
}


goal - implement a simple version of my optimization problem in Python
{
    - DONE look at how "Verifiable" defines their problem in Gurobipy
    - DONE define the f_c functions as discretely sampled functions
        - then you'll give these discrete samples to Gurobi to choose the best values
    - Define some simple high-level model with only 1 path to the goal to get the communication optimization part working
}
